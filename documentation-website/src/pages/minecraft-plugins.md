# Minecraft Plugins

Here, you can find all of the official documentation for any of the Minecraft plugins that I create!

For these plugins to work, you will need to run a **minecraft server platform** that is based off of **CraftBukkit**. These servers have the ability to run plugins, which allow you to add custom functionality to the server
without needing to mod the game. Becuase of this, anyone can join the server and enjoy the custom functionality with a completely fresh, vanilla install of Minecraft! Because of this, it is **NOT** possible to use these plugins
on a normal minecraft server!!!

:::note NOTE

I am still very new at creating minecraft plugins and all of these are made for fun. I cannot guarantee either consistent development or that projects will even be completed! I am going to do my best
to create enjoyable experiences for as many people as possible!

Below are all the Minecraft plugins that have documentation available:
