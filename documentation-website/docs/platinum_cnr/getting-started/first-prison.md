# Setting Up Your First Prison

Installing **Platinum Cops and Robbers** is extremely simple. You will have a server up and running with this plugin in no time, especially if you follow this guide.

## STEP 1: Create a Minecraft Server

For this plugin to work, you will need to run a **minecraft server platform** that is based off of **CraftBukkit**. These servers have the ability to run plugins, which allow you to add custom functionality to the server
without needing to mod the game. Becuase of this, anyone can join the server and enjoy the custom functionality with a completely fresh, vanilla install of Minecraft!

The main current server platforms available are **[Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/)**, **[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)** and **[Paper](https://papermc.io/)**. The plugin will work with all of these servers, so it is really
just personal preference.

:::tip Recommendation

I would highly recommend that you use **[Paper](https://papermc.io/)** for your Minecraft server, as it contains a large amount of performance improvements over Spigot and Bukkit and has a quickly growing community!

## STEP 2: Install Platinum Cops and Robbers

Once you **Monecraft server** is created, you can then download the latest releases of **Platinum Cops and Robbers** from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/). Once you have successfuly downloaded the file, you will then need to either
**copy** or **move** the downloaded `PlatinumCNR.jar` file into the `plugins/` directory within your root server directory.

:::tip Tip

If you downloaded the file from **SpigotMC**, you may need to unzip the downloaded file first!

:::

After you have completed this, you can either **restart your server** or you can **reload your server** using the `/reload` command, though this is not recommended, but should still work.

**CONGRATULATIONS!!!** You have successfuly installed **Platinum Cops and Robbers** onto your Miencraft server! If you would like, you can use `/plugins` to get a list of plugins installed on your server. If the installation was successful, you should
see **"PlatinumCNR"** listed when using this command!
