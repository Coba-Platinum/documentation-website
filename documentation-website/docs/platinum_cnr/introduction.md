## Welcome to Platinum Cops and Robbers!

Welcome to the official documentation for using the **Platinum Cops and Robbers** plugin for Minecraft servers!. 

:::danger WARNING

This plugin, along with being my very first Minecraft plugin, is also still early in development. Please expect to run into missing features or things not working as intended as you use this plugin!

:::

## Why was this plugin made?

The story behind this plugin is short and simple! My friends and I wanted to
play some of the old-school Cops and Robbers maps that we enjoyed within Minecraft when we were younger. Unfortunetely due to the rework of command block syntax, almost all of the maps that we
came across were completely unusable. We attempted to fix one of the maps ourselves, but it ended up being too much effort for a single map. Because of this, I decided to search for a Cops and Robbers
plugin to use on a Paper server, but there were only a couple available and they were both quite dated and basic. At this point I decided to create my own plugin from scratch and release it to the public
for anyone else wanting to have a greate Minecraft Cops and Robbers experience to use!



## Features

:::tip Do you have an idea or request for a feature?

Too bad

:::

Platinum CNR is the ultimate Cops and Robbers plugin, providing a more gameplay filled, intense, and customizable experience of any other plugin of its kind. Some features that this 
packed plugin include are:

- **Fully automated** experience! Once you setup the prison, the plugin will to the rest!
- Support for **multiple prisons**, even in **different worlds**!
- Create **custom prisons** of any size!
    - Prison **player limits** are automatically set based on how many **prison cells** are available, but this can be customized.
- **Automatic Prison Restoration** after the end of each game! Players can be as **destructive** as you like within the prisons!
    - This is currently done by having the game take place in a instance of the source world. This works perfectly for now, but may be changed in the future.
- Each prison can be **individually customized**, allowing for completely different experiences within each prison!
- Automatic selection of **Wardens** and **Prisoners** at the begining of each game!
- A plethora of **custom items** that can be used by both Wardens and Prisoners throughout the game!
- Prisoner only **Prison Stash** to allow prisoners to both stash and destribute items between prison cells!
- and **much, much more**!
